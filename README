GLD: jQuery is vulnerable version. I dismissed the alarm, since I no longer use this app, and I don't know how to point it at a more recent version.

A tornado-based web frontend for pianobar (command line pandora client).

This is meant to be used from a mobile phone to control a computer
hooked up to speakers.

Dependencies:
 - pianobar (brew install pianobar)
 - easy_install appscript
 - easy_install tornado
